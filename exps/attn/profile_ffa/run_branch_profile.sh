# --- Script Description ---
# Purpose: Runs benchmark tests for both 'dense' and 'block_sparse' types.
# Arguments:
#   $1: The required <branch_name> to generate unique output filenames.
#   $2: The required <output_dir> where the files will be saved.
# Usage: ./run_benchmark.sh your_branch_name path/to/output_dir

# 1. Check if exactly two arguments are provided
if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Error: This script requires exactly two arguments."
    echo "Usage: $0 <branch_name> <output_dir>"
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Assign the arguments to more readable variables
BRANCH_NAME=$1
OUTPUT_DIR=$2

echo "================================================="
echo "Received Branch Name: $BRANCH_NAME"
echo "Output Directory: $OUTPUT_DIR"
echo "================================================="

# 3. Run the dense type test
#    The output path is now constructed with the directory prefix.

echo "" # Print a blank line for spacing
echo "Running dense test, outputting to file: $OUTPUT_DENSE ..."

# 4. Run the block_sparse type test
#    The output path is now constructed with the directory prefix.
