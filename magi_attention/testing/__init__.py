    """
    This function simulates pytest.mark.parameterize with multi-process support.

    Default Behavior (Replication Mode):
    In a distributed environment, every rank will execute every single test case.
    This is necessary for tests that require collective communication.

    Optional Behavior (Distribution Mode):
    If the test function is decorated with `@distribute_parameterized_test_cases`,
    the test cases will be split among the available ranks. This is ideal for
    speeding up tests where each case is independent.

    This version implements "fail-fast": the run stops on the first failure.

    Args:
        argument (str): The name of the argument to parameterize.
        values (list[Any]): A list of values for this argument.
