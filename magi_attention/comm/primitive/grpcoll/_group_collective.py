        input (torch.Tensor): input tensor with shape [input_seqlen, ...]
        output (torch.Tensor | None): output tensor buffer with shape [output_seqlen, ...]
            or None to let the function allocate the output buffer itself

        input_split_sizes (list[int] | torch.Tensor):
            the 1D size list / tensor to split the input tensor,
            where sum(input_split_sizes) == input_seqlen

        output_split_sizes (list[int] | torch.Tensor):
            the 1D size list / tensor to split the output tensor,
            where sum(output_split_sizes) == output_seqlen, except that:
            if the seqlen of output buffer is not accurately known but has a maximum value,
            we actually allow sum(output_split_sizes) < output_seqlen,
            where the right-padded entries in the output buffer are ignored,
            which is helpful in some cases to avoid GPU-CPU sync

        dst_indices (list[list[int]] | torch.Tensor):
            the 2D destination rank indices list / tensor for each input split to send to,

            NOTE:
                1. if dst_indices is a 2D list, then len(dst_indices) == len(input_split_sizes),

                and dst_indices[i, :] indicates the distinct destination ranks for the i-th input split to send to
                where the right-padded entries should be filled with ``-1``

        src_index (list[int] | torch.Tensor):
            the 1D source rank index list / tensor for each output split to receive from,
            where len(src_index) == len(output_split_sizes)

            NOTE:
                1. the order of the output splits are "stable",
                i.e. the ones from the same source will be in the same order as the input splits
                2. if the length of src_index is not accurately known but has a maximum value,
                we actually allow src_index to be right-padded with invalid ``world_size``,
                where the corr. entries in the output_split_sizes are also supposed to be right-padded with ``0``,
                which is helpful in some cases to avoid GPU-CPU sync

        group (dist.ProcessGroup): the process group to comm
        async_op (bool): whether to use async op. Defaults to ``False``
        cast_lse (bool): whether to cast the log-sum-exp tensor along with the input tensor. Defaults to ``False``.

        input_lse (torch.Tensor | None): the log-sum-exp tensor w.r.t. the input tensor,
            only required and used when ``cast_lse`` is ``True``,
        output_lse (torch.Tensor | None): the log-sum-exp tensor w.r.t. the output tensor,
            only required and used when ``cast_lse`` is ``True``

            NOTE:
                1. the input/output lse tensors can have different dtypes from the ones of input/output tensors,
                and for now we only support ``float32`` dtype for lse tensors.
                2. the shapes of input/output lse tensors must be 3D shape as ``[seqlen, num_heads, head_dim]``,
                which are also supposed to be aligned with the ones of input/output tensors semantically
